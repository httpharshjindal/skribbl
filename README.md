# Skribbllle.io Clone - Multiplayer Drawing & Guessing Game

Welcome to **Skribbllle.io**, a fun multiplayer drawing and guessing game where friends can play together, compete, and have a blast! This project is a clone of the popular game **Skribbl.io**, with real-time interactions, colorful drawings, and a scoreboard that updates instantly. üñåÔ∏èüé®

## How It Works

- **Players:** All players take turns drawing and guessing.
- **Drawing:** The selected player is given a random word and has 60 seconds to draw it on the canvas.
  - **Canvas Tools:** Multiple colors are available, and there's a **clear button** to erase the drawing.
- **Guessing:** The other players guess the word by typing it into the message section.
  - **Points:** A correct guess earns **100 points**.
- **Real-Time Scoring:** The scoreboard is updated in real-time for all players to see.
- **Game End:** After each round, players are ranked based on their score, and the game ends with a winner crowned! üèÜ
